# todolist-cpsc312p1
 a todo list written in haskell

## What is the problem?
Keeping track of things that needed to be done is difficult and stressful. Having a to-do list that has all your tasks in one place ensures you don't forget and gives you peace of mind and increases your productivity.

## What is the something extra?
The to-do list is able to send a notification email 1 hour before the deadline (can be toggled on/off) to remind the user to finish the task before the deadline.
